PRP EDD Evaluation Tool

Can I get a hooooooYAAAAAAAAA

Ever wish you could take that incomprehensible gibberish that is the ADAPT file and turn it into something useful? Well now you can with this nifty little tool.
To make this work you must have python installed on you computer. Then you can install the main script, version EDDeval6.py, by simply downloading it to your computer. Then from there put it in a handy folder in your documents folder or desktop. Also, download the dictionaries of Leachability, Direct exposure and GCTLs. Put those in the same folder as your script. 

Then when you receive an ADAPT EDD, take the csv file (make sure it is unzipped) and drag and drop it on the script file. If all goes well you should get a console window pop up with information showing a hitlist, an NADC exceedance list, a GCTL exceedance list, a leachability exceedance list, and a SCTL direct exposure exceedance list.
